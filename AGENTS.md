# PromptHub — Local Agent Handoff & Project Overview

This file is the shared handoff surface for coding agents working in this
local PromptHub checkout. Keep it current when a completed change alters the
core product direction, app architecture, feature scope, build path, or agent
workflow.

## 0. Current Local Goal

The user is simplifying the upstream GitHub PromptHub project into a personal
macOS desktop app.

The simplified app must remain a real Electron desktop application that can be
packaged into a macOS `.dmg`. Do not turn this into a web-only app, a CLI-only
tool, or a partial prototype that cannot be packaged.

### Core Features To Preserve

These are the user's core workflows. Treat them as protected unless the user
explicitly changes direction:

- Prompt management: create, edit, organize, tag, search, copy, and keep prompt
  version history.
- Skill management: create, edit, import, scan local `SKILL.md` files, inspect
  skill content, and keep skill version history.
- Multi-platform Skill distribution: install/deploy/sync Skills into supported
  AI coding tool platforms such as Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf,
  Gemini CLI, Kilo Code, and similar configured targets.
- macOS packaging: keep `pnpm electron:build:mac` working and verify that an
  Apple Silicon (`arm64`) `.dmg` can be generated before calling a
  simplification milestone complete. The user does not need Intel (`x64`)
  packages.

### Features That Are Not Core For The User

These can be hidden, disabled, or removed during simplification, provided the
protected core workflows and macOS packaging keep working:

- Self-hosted Web app and web-server product surface.
- Standalone CLI product surface and desktop CLI installer management.
- Public marketing/docs website.
- WebDAV, S3, and self-hosted PromptHub sync.
- AI prompt testing, AI prompt generation, AI Skill drafting, and AI rewrite or
  polish flows.
- Rules management for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, etc., unless
  the user later says this is needed.
- Auto-update flows for public releases.
- Advanced appearance features such as background image, animation tuning, and
  nonessential UI customization.
- Extra locales beyond the language(s) the user chooses to keep.

### Simplification Strategy

Prefer staged simplification over large deletions:

1. First narrow the desktop UI to Prompt, Skill, and multi-platform Skill
   distribution while leaving the build structure intact.
2. Then remove unused renderer UI, preload APIs, IPC handlers, main-process
   services, dependencies, and tests by feature area.
3. Only after the desktop app still builds should agents remove outer product
   packages such as `apps/web`, `apps/cli`, and `website`.
4. After each meaningful stage, run focused checks first, then `pnpm build` or
   `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop build`; before final completion run
   `pnpm electron:build:mac`.

Do not remove the Electron/Vite/electron-builder chain unless replacing it with
an equally working macOS packaging chain approved by the user.

### Current Simplification Status

- Stage 1/2/3 simplification has been completed for the current desktop
  package:
  - Default desktop modules are now Prompt and Skill only.
  - Settings now exposes General, Appearance, Data, Skill, and About.
  - Data Settings no longer exposes WebDAV, S3, or self-hosted PromptHub sync
    subsections.
  - Top bar Prompt creation now opens the manual Prompt modal instead of
    AI/Quick Add.
  - Top bar public update notification is hidden.
  - Rules has been removed from renderer-level main content routing, top bar
    search, and sidebar panel code.
  - Prompt screens no longer show the main AI test actions in the context menu,
    table view, kanban view, detail action bar, or AI test modal entry.
  - Skill creation no longer shows AI Draft or AI Polish entry points.
  - Prompt detail/list unreachable AI test execution code has been removed from
    the renderer.
  - Skill creation unreachable AI draft/polish execution code has been removed
    from the renderer.
  - Settings no longer dynamically imports `rules.store`, and visible Rules
    export/path settings have been removed from Data/Skill settings.
  - Desktop preload/main no longer expose or register Rules/CLI APIs. Orphan
    Rules/CLI renderer files and desktop Rules/CLI service files were deleted.
  - Desktop backup/import no longer collects or restores Rules data.
  - Desktop auto-update has been removed from the renderer, preload, and main
    process. About settings no longer exposes update checks or preview-channel
    controls.
  - Desktop background/startup/save cloud sync behavior is disabled. WebDAV,
    S3, and self-hosted sync no longer run automatically after launch, on a
    timer, after window resume, or after local Prompt/Folder saves.
  - Desktop main/preload no longer register or expose WebDAV/S3 IPC. The
    unused main-process WebDAV/S3 service files were deleted.
  - Remaining hidden cloud sync renderer services and save-sync scheduler were
    deleted; local backup/import remains.
  - Remaining desktop AI IPC/preload/main service files were deleted; Skill
    safety scan now uses static scanning and returns `scanMethod: "static"`.
  - `apps/web`, `apps/cli`, and `website` were removed from this local
    simplified checkout.
  - Renderer locale assets are now only `zh` and `en`.
  - Advanced Appearance controls for desktop background image and animation
    tuning were removed from the UI.
  - macOS packaging is Apple Silicon only: `electron:build:mac` passes
    `--arm64`, and `electron-builder.json` only targets `arm64` for DMG/ZIP.
- Verified during simplification:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm install --lockfile-only`
  - `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop build`
  - `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck`
  - `pnpm electron:build:mac`, producing
    `apps/desktop/dist/PromptHub-0.5.7-beta.2-arm64.dmg`.
- Important remaining cleanup ideas:
  - Settings store and shared type files still contain some legacy compatibility
    fields for AI/cloud sync/rules. They are not visible product workflows now,
    but can be removed in a later deeper cleanup with focused migration checks.
  - Some old tests still describe removed non-core workflows and should be
    pruned before relying on the full legacy test suite.

## 1. Current Repository Shape

This checkout is a monorepo, not the older single `src/` layout described in
some upstream docs.

- `apps/desktop/`: primary Electron desktop app. This is the simplification
  target and must keep building as a macOS app.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/`: Electron main process, native integration, IPC
  registration, data path handling, security, and service logic.
- `apps/desktop/src/preload/`: context bridge APIs exposed to the renderer.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/`: React UI, Zustand stores, renderer services,
  i18n, Prompt/Skill/Settings/Layout components.
- `packages/shared/`: shared types, constants, IPC channel names, platform
  registries, and utility types.
- `packages/db/`: shared SQLite database layer used by desktop/web/CLI.
- `packages/core/`: shared core services, including CLI and rules/platform
  helpers.
- `apps/web/`: removed from this local simplified checkout.
- `apps/cli/`: removed from this local simplified checkout.
- `website/`: removed from this local simplified checkout.
- `spec/`: internal project specs, change records, rules, and knowledge docs.
- `docs/`: repository-facing documentation and images.

Key packaging files:

- `package.json`: root scripts and workspace entry.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: workspace package list.
- `apps/desktop/package.json`: desktop scripts, including
  `electron:build:mac`.
- `apps/desktop/electron-builder.json`: macOS `.dmg`/`.zip` packaging config.
- `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts`: renderer/main/preload build configuration.

## 2. Agent Handoff Rules

When a new agent starts in this repository:

1. Read this file first.
2. Check `git status --short` before editing. Never revert changes you did not
   make unless the user explicitly asks.
3. Treat Prompt management, Skill management, multi-platform Skill
   distribution, and macOS `.dmg` packaging as the protected product core.
4. If the task is exploratory or the user is unsure, discuss the plan before
   editing. If the user explicitly asks to implement, keep changes scoped.
5. For non-trivial feature removals/refactors, create or update a change folder
   under `spec/changes/active/<change-key>/` before code changes, following the
   spec workflow below.
6. Update this `AGENTS.md` after completing any core directional change, such
   as changing the protected feature set, removing an app/package, changing the
   packaging command, or altering the simplification strategy.
7. Record what was verified. A simplification is not complete merely because
   files were deleted; the desktop app must still build, and final milestones
   must prove macOS packaging.
8. Prefer Chinese for project handoff files, change records, plans, and user
   explanations unless a file is clearly upstream-facing English documentation.
9. The user does not understand programming details. Explain work in product
   terms first, keep technical terms short, and translate why a change matters
   instead of only naming files or APIs.

## 3. Useful Commands

Use workspace-aware commands:

| Command                                      | Description                                  |
| :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                               | Install dependencies                         |
| `pnpm electron:dev`                          | Start desktop dev environment                |
| `pnpm build`                                 | Build the desktop app via the root script    |
| `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop build`     | Build only the desktop app                   |
| `pnpm electron:build:mac`                    | Build macOS `.dmg` and `.zip` desktop assets |
| `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck` | Type-check the desktop app                   |
| `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop lint`      | Lint the desktop app                         |
| `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop test:unit` | Run desktop unit tests                       |

Prefer focused checks while actively editing, then broader checks before
declaring completion.

## 2. Architecture

The application follows the standard Electron process model:

### Main Process (`src/main`)

- Handles native OS interactions, file system access, database operations, and security (encryption).
- **Entry:** `src/main/index.ts`
- **Database:** Direct SQLite access via `better-sqlite3`. Schema defined in `src/main/database/schema.ts`. Adapter in `src/main/database/sqlite.ts`.
- **IPC:** Exposes functionality to the renderer via `ipcMain.handle()` handlers registered in `src/main/ipc/`.
- **Security:** Master password, encryption/decryption in `src/main/security.ts`.
- **Services:** Business logic for skills (installer, validator, repo sync, sanitizer) in `src/main/services/`.

### Renderer Process (`src/renderer`)

- A React SPA responsible for the UI/UX.
- **Entry:** `src/renderer/main.tsx`
- **Communication:** Uses `window.api` (exposed via `contextBridge` in `src/preload/index.ts`) to call Main process methods.
- **State:** Zustand stores in `src/renderer/stores/` (prompt, folder, skill, settings, ui).
- **Services:** Frontend services in `src/renderer/services/` (AI client, WebDAV, skill platform sync, etc.).

### Data Layer

- **Local Storage:** SQLite database stores prompts, versions, folders, skills, skill versions, and settings.
- **Search:** Uses SQLite FTS5 for full-text search (`prompts_fts` virtual table).
- **Sync:** WebDAV support for backup and sync.
- **Skill Files:** Skills stored as SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter metadata, synced between DB and local repo via `skill-repo-sync.ts`.

## 5. Key Conventions

### IPC Communication

- **Channel Definitions:** All IPC channel strings are defined in `src/shared/constants/ipc-channels.ts`.
- **Pattern:** Renderer invokes `window.api.method()` → `ipcRenderer.invoke(channel, ...args)` → Main process handles with `ipcMain.handle(channel, handler)`.
- **Naming:** Channels follow `domain:action` format (e.g., `prompt:create`, `skill:update`, `folder:delete`).

### Database Schema

- **Prompts:** Stores title, content, variables (JSON), tags (JSON), and folder association. Supports versioning via `prompt_versions` table.
- **Folders:** Hierarchical structure with `parent_id` and `sort_order` for ordering. Supports CASCADE delete.
- **Skills:** Stores skill metadata, instructions, versioning. Syncs with local SKILL.md files.
- **FTS:** `prompts_fts` virtual table (FTS5) for full-text search on title + content + tags.
- **Migrations:** Schema versioning handled in `src/main/database/index.ts`.

### Component Styling

- **Tailwind CSS:** Used exclusively for styling. Design tokens include `bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, etc.
- **Theme:** Supports Dark/Light modes via CSS variables and Tailwind's `dark:` prefix.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react` is the standard icon set. No other icon libraries.

### Internationalization

- **Library:** `react-i18next` with `i18next` backend.
- **Usage:** `const { t } = useTranslation();`
- **Keys:** Structured keys with dot notation (e.g., `folder.create`, `common.cancel`, `settings.addNModels`).
- **Locales:** 7 supported: `en`, `zh`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `fr`, `de`, `es`.
- **All user-facing strings must use i18n.** See Section 8.3.

## 6. Development Workflow

### 6.1 Documentation Operating System (DOS)

PromptHub uses a project-native Documentation Operating System (DOS). Internal SSD assets live under `spec/`, while repository-facing docs stay under `docs/`.

PromptHub now uses `spec-init` directories for stable project docs and an OpenSpec-style change workflow for deltas:

- `spec-init` provides the project-level document boundaries for workflow / knowledge / changes / records
- PromptHub's change-management backbone remains `spec/changes/active/<change-key>/specs/<domain>/spec.md` plus `spec/changes/archive/`; stable truth now lives in `spec/workflow/*`, `spec/knowledge/*`, `spec/rules/`, `spec/releases/`, and related record folders

The expected SSD loop is:

`requirements -> spec -> design -> tasks -> implementation -> sync -> archive`

#### Document Roles

- `spec/workflow/00-intake/`: project-level intake entry for why the work matters, target users, constraints, and non-goals.
- `spec/workflow/01-requirements/`: project-level requirements entry for FR / NFR / AC style requirements.
- `spec/workflow/02-design/`: project-level design entry for architecture, module boundaries, data, interfaces, and tradeoffs.
- `spec/workflow/03-implementation/`: project-level implementation-planning entry for sequencing and milestones.
- `spec/workflow/04-verification/`: project-level verification-planning entry.
- `spec/workflow/05-tasks/`: project-level executable task entry.
- `spec/knowledge/context/`: long-lived context docs for stable terminology, actors, entities, and business boundaries.

#### Required Artifacts For Non-Trivial Work

For any non-trivial feature, refactor, migration, cross-process change, or multi-file bug fix, create or update one active change folder under `spec/changes/active/<change-key>/`.

Each active change should contain:

1. `proposal.md` — why the change exists, scope, risks, rollback thinking, and impacted user flows.
2. `specs/<domain>/spec.md` — the intended behavior delta, including added, modified, and removed requirements or scenarios.
3. `design.md` — technical approach, affected modules, data model / IPC / sync / migration impact, and tradeoffs.
4. `tasks.md` — a concrete implementation checklist with verification items.
5. `implementation.md` — what actually shipped, what changed during execution, what was verified, and which stable docs were synced.

Use one or more domain spec files under `specs/` when the change spans multiple stable domains. Do not create a flat top-level `spec.md` file inside the change folder for new work.

#### Workflow Expectations

1. Start with the change folder before writing significant code.
2. Use the `spec-init` document boundaries to decide what kind of document a piece of content belongs in, but keep non-trivial implementation work inside `spec/changes/active/<change-key>/`.
3. Refine `proposal.md`, `specs/<domain>/spec.md`, and `design.md` as understanding improves; the workflow is iterative, not phase-locked.
4. Use `tasks.md` as the implementation checklist and mark items complete as work lands.
5. Update `implementation.md` during or immediately after implementation so the executed work does not live only in git diff or chat history.
6. When the change ships, sync current behavior back into `spec/workflow/*` and `spec/knowledge/*`, and sync stable rules, release summaries, or decisions into `spec/rules/`, `spec/releases/`, or `spec/adr/` where appropriate.
7. After shipping or abandoning the work, move the change folder to `spec/changes/archive/` rather than deleting it.

#### When To Update Existing Change vs Start New One

- Update the existing change when the user problem and intended outcome stay the same, but execution details or scope boundaries evolve.
- Start a new change when the objective materially changes, the original work can stand on its own, or the history would become confusing if kept in one folder.

#### Implementation Discipline

- Do not let requirements live only in chat history when the work is significant.
- Do not confuse the new `spec/workflow/*` and `spec/knowledge/*` project-level entry points with replacements for active change records; they classify document intent, while `spec/changes/active/` remains the execution record for non-trivial work.
- Do not edit `spec/workflow/*`, `spec/knowledge/*`, `spec/rules/`, `spec/releases/`, or `spec/adr/` as if they were scratchpads for active work; active deltas belong in `spec/changes/active/` first.
- Do not treat `tasks.md` as optional for substantial changes; it is the execution contract.
- Do not treat `implementation.md` as optional for substantial changes; it is the executed record of what really landed.
- Do not close a change folder without updating its verification status and follow-up notes.
- Repository-facing documentation should live under `docs/` unless it must remain at the repository root for tooling or platform conventions, such as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `AGENTS.md`. Internal SSD, specs, and architecture records belong in `spec/`.

### 6.2 Engineering Flow

1. **Plan:** For non-trivial work, create or update a change folder in `spec/changes/active/` using the templates.
2. **Modify:** Edit React components in `renderer` or backend logic in `main`.
3. **IPC:** If adding new features requiring backend access, update `ipc-channels.ts`, implement handler in `main/ipc`, and expose via `preload`.
4. **Test:** Run `pnpm test -- --run` to verify logic. Run `pnpm lint` to verify code quality.
5. **Record:** Update `implementation.md` with the actual execution path, verification, and follow-up notes.
6. **Sync Docs:** Update `spec/workflow/*` when project-level goals or requirements changed, update `spec/knowledge/behavior/` or `spec/knowledge/reference/` when stable behavior/assets changed, update `spec/knowledge/structure/` when the shipped internal architecture contract changed, update `spec/releases/` or `spec/adr/` when release or decision records changed, and update user-facing docs in `docs/` or `README.md` when the contributor/user contract changed.
7. **Commit:** Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `test: ...`).

## 7. Testing Standards

### 7.1 Core Principles

> Tests exist to **find bugs**, not to inflate coverage numbers. Every test must have a clear reason to exist — if a test can never fail, it is worthless. If a test only verifies the happy path with obvious inputs, it is insufficient.

| Principle                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Real bugs, not rubber stamps**      | Every test must target a scenario that could realistically fail in production. Avoid trivially-passing tests that merely confirm a function returns the same hardcoded value it was given. |
| **Test behavior, not implementation** | Assert on observable outcomes (return values, DB state, side effects), not internal private methods or call counts. Tests that break on harmless refactors are fragile.                    |
| **Root cause verification**           | After fixing a bug, the regression test must reproduce the original failure condition — not merely call the fixed code path.                                                               |
| **No fake implementations**           | Prohibited: `setTimeout` to simulate async, hardcoded mock return values that bypass real logic, `jest.fn().mockReturnValue(expectedResult)` that makes the test a tautology.              |
| **No lazy assertions**                | Prohibited: `expect(result).toBeDefined()` when the actual value matters; `expect(fn).not.toThrow()` without checking the return value; `.toMatchSnapshot()` for dynamic data.             |

### 7.2 Test Categories (All Required for New Modules)

#### 7.2.1 Functional Tests

| Aspect                  | Requirements                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Happy path**          | Cover the primary use case with realistic inputs.                                                                                  |
| **Boundary conditions** | Empty string, null, undefined, zero, negative numbers, MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, empty arrays, single-element arrays.                      |
| **Error paths**         | Invalid inputs must produce correct errors, not silent failures. Verify error messages/types, not just that an error was thrown.   |
| **State transitions**   | For stateful modules (stores, DB, auth): test the full lifecycle (create → read → update → delete) and verify intermediate states. |

#### 7.2.2 Adversarial / Fuzz Tests

| Aspect                    | Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL injection**         | All user-facing string inputs (title, description, tags, search keywords) must be tested with SQL injection payloads: `'; DROP TABLE x; --`, `" OR 1=1 --`, `UNION SELECT`. Verify the table is intact after each attempt. |
| **XSS-like content**      | Store and retrieve `<script>alert(1)</script>`, HTML entities, and JS event handlers in all text fields.                                                                                                                   |
| **Unicode / CJK / Emoji** | Full round-trip (write → read) with CJK characters, emoji (including multi-codepoint like 🏳️‍🌈), RTL text (Arabic/Hebrew), zero-width characters.                                                                            |
| **Null bytes**            | Test `\x00` in string fields — SQLite truncates at null bytes via `better-sqlite3`, causing silent data loss. Document this behavior in tests.                                                                             |
| **Extreme sizes**         | 10KB+ strings, 100+ element arrays, 1MB payloads for encryption. Verify no crashes and data integrity.                                                                                                                     |
| **Special characters**    | Backslashes, quotes (single/double), newlines, tabs, CRLF, Unicode BOM, control characters (0x01–0x1F).                                                                                                                    |

#### 7.2.3 Security Tests

| Aspect                             | Requirements                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cryptographic tamper detection** | For encrypted data: test bit-flips in IV, auth tag, and ciphertext independently. Verify all produce rejection (null/error), not silent decryption to garbage. |
| **Key/password boundaries**        | Empty password, 10KB password, unicode password, password with null bytes. Verify old password fails after reset.                                              |
| **Timing safety**                  | Where `timingSafeEqual` is used, verify that wrong-length inputs don't crash (Node.js throws if buffers differ in length).                                     |
| **Input validation**               | All IPC handlers must reject malformed inputs. Test with wrong types, missing required fields, extra unknown fields.                                           |
| **Path traversal**                 | File path inputs must be tested with `../`, absolute paths, symlinks, and null bytes.                                                                          |

#### 7.2.4 Performance / Stress Tests

| Aspect                         | Requirements                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch operations**           | 100+ creates followed by bulk delete. Verify count accuracy and no orphaned records.                                |
| **Rapid sequential mutations** | 50+ updates to same record in tight loop. Verify final state is deterministic and no version/counter drift.         |
| **Concurrent-like access**     | Multiple operations in same transaction/tick. Verify data consistency (especially for version numbers, sort_order). |
| **State cycling**              | 10+ cycles of set→lock→unlock, create→delete, enable→disable. Verify no state leaks across cycles.                  |

#### 7.2.5 Integration Tests (Database)

| Aspect                    | Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use real SQLite**       | Database tests MUST use `new DatabaseAdapter(":memory:")` with the real schema (`SCHEMA_TABLES` + `SCHEMA_INDEXES`), NOT mocks. Mocked databases cannot catch SQL syntax errors, constraint violations, or trigger behavior. |
| **Foreign key behavior**  | Test CASCADE deletes, SET NULL behavior, and constraint violations explicitly.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Transaction atomicity** | For operations wrapped in `db.transaction()`: verify that partial failures roll back completely.                                                                                                                             |
| **FTS correctness**       | Full-text search tests must include special FTS5 operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`, `*`, `^`, `"phrase"`, `column:`) and verify they don't cause SQL errors.                                                             |

### 7.3 Prohibited Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                      | Why It's Harmful                           | Correct Approach                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `expect(result).toBeDefined()` alone              | Passes for any value including wrong ones  | Assert the specific expected value                                     |
| `expect(fn).not.toThrow()` without value check    | Confirms no crash but not correctness      | Assert both no-throw AND correct return value                          |
| Mock that returns the expected value              | Test becomes a tautology (always passes)   | Mock dependencies, assert on SUT behavior                              |
| `as any` / `@ts-ignore` in test code              | Hides type errors that are real bugs       | Fix the types; if testing JS interop, use explicit casts with comments |
| Testing private methods directly                  | Couples test to implementation             | Test through public API                                                |
| `toMatchSnapshot()` for dynamic data              | Snapshot bloat, meaningless diffs          | Use specific assertions                                                |
| Copy-paste test blocks with minor variations      | Hard to maintain, masks missing edge cases | Use `it.each()` or parameterized tests                                 |
| `beforeEach` that creates unnecessary fixtures    | Slow tests, hidden dependencies            | Create fixtures in the specific test that needs them                   |
| Catching errors just to assert `instanceof Error` | Doesn't verify the error message or cause  | Assert `error.message` contains specific text                          |

### 7.4 Test File Organization

```

**Naming convention:** `<module-name>.test.ts` — matches the source file it tests.

**Structure within test files:**

```typescript
describe("ModuleName", () => {
  describe("methodName", () => {
    it("does X when given Y", () => { ... });         // Happy path
    it("returns null for non-existent id", () => { ... }); // Error path
  });
  describe("adversarial inputs", () => {
    // Fuzz / boundary / injection tests grouped together
  });
});
```

### 7.5 Running Tests

| Command                                 | Purpose                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `pnpm test -- --run`                    | Full test suite (all files)    |
| `pnpm test -- <path> --run`             | Single file                    |
| `pnpm test -- --run --reporter=verbose` | Verbose output with test names |
| `pnpm test -- --run --coverage`         | With coverage report           |

**Rule:** After adding new tests, always run the full suite (`pnpm test -- --run`) to ensure no regressions. Every PR must have 0 test failures and 0 lint errors.

### 7.6 Coverage Targets

| Layer                      | Minimum | Priority                              |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `src/main/database/`       | 80%+    | **Critical** — data integrity         |
| `src/main/security.ts`     | 90%+    | **Critical** — encryption correctness |
| `src/main/services/`       | 70%+    | High — business logic                 |
| `src/main/ipc/`            | 60%+    | High — input validation               |
| `src/renderer/stores/`     | 60%+    | Medium — state management             |
| `src/renderer/services/`   | 80%+    | High — AI client correctness          |
| `src/renderer/components/` | 40%+    | Lower — UI interactions               |

### 7.7 What Makes a Test "Good"

A good test:

1. **Fails when the code is broken** — If you comment out the implementation, the test must fail.
2. **Passes when the code is correct** — No flaky behavior, no timing dependencies.
3. **Documents the expected behavior** — The test name and assertions serve as living documentation.
4. **Catches regressions** — A future developer changing the code incorrectly will be stopped by this test.
5. **Is independent** — Can run in any order, doesn't depend on other tests' side effects.
6. **Is fast** — Unit tests should complete in milliseconds, not seconds.

A bad test:

1. Always passes regardless of implementation.
2. Tests implementation details that change on refactor.
3. Has vague assertions (`toBeDefined`, `toBeTruthy`) when specific values are known.
4. Requires network, filesystem, or timing to pass.
5. Is a copy-paste of another test with one variable changed.

## 8. Code Quality Rules

### 8.1 TypeScript Strictness

| Rule                        | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No `any`**                | The `any` type is globally prohibited by ESLint. Use proper types, generics, or `unknown` with type guards.    |
| **No `@ts-ignore`**         | Fix the underlying type error instead of suppressing it.                                                       |
| **No `as` type assertions** | Unless truly necessary for interop; must include a comment explaining why.                                     |
| **Explicit return types**   | All exported functions must have explicit return type annotations.                                             |
| **Strict null checks**      | Handle `null` and `undefined` explicitly. No optional chaining as a substitute for proper null handling logic. |

### 8.2 Error Handling

| Rule                        | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No empty catch blocks**   | Every `catch` must either re-throw, log with full stack, or handle the error meaningfully.                   |
| **No silent failures**      | Functions must not swallow errors and return default values. If an operation can fail, the caller must know. |
| **Specific error messages** | Error messages must include context (what failed, with what input). Not just "Error occurred".               |
| **IPC error propagation**   | IPC handlers must catch errors and return structured error responses, never crash the main process silently. |

### 8.3 Internationalization (i18n) Rules

| Rule                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No hardcoded user-facing strings** | All text visible to users must go through `t()` from `react-i18next`. This includes button labels, error messages, placeholders, tooltips, and status text.  |
| **No hardcoded Chinese**             | Hardcoded Chinese characters in source code (outside of locale JSON files) are prohibited. This is enforced by regression tests.                             |
| **All 7 locales must be updated**    | When adding a new i18n key, it must be added to ALL locale files: `en.json`, `zh.json`, `zh-TW.json`, `ja.json`, `fr.json`, `de.json`, `es.json`.            |
| **Key naming**                       | Use dot-notation structured keys: `domain.action` (e.g., `skill.formatDirectoryRepo`, `settings.addNModels`).                                                |
| **Interpolation**                    | Use i18next interpolation for dynamic values: `t('settings.addNModels', { count: n })`. Never concatenate translated strings.                                |
| **Backend error messages**           | Error messages in the main process (thrown from IPC handlers, services) should be in English, as they are typically logged, not displayed directly to users. |

### 8.4 Database Rules

| Rule                                       | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parameterized queries only**             | All SQL queries must use parameterized placeholders (`?`). String concatenation for SQL values is absolutely prohibited.                             |
| **Foreign keys enforced**                  | `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` must be set. All FK constraints must use explicit `ON DELETE` behavior (CASCADE or SET NULL).                             |
| **Transactions for multi-step operations** | Any operation that involves multiple SQL statements must be wrapped in `db.transaction()`.                                                           |
| **FTS sync**                               | When updating prompts, the FTS index must be kept in sync. Use triggers or explicit FTS update statements.                                           |
| **Schema migrations**                      | All schema changes must go through the migration system in `src/main/database/index.ts`. Never modify `schema.ts` without a corresponding migration. |
| **Null byte awareness**                    | `better-sqlite3` truncates strings at `\x00`. Input validation should strip null bytes from user input before database writes.                       |

### 8.5 Security Rules

| Rule                          | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AES-256-GCM**               | All encryption uses AES-256-GCM with random IV. Never reuse IVs.                                                          |
| **Master password**           | Derived via scrypt (or equivalent KDF). Never stored in plaintext.                                                        |
| **No secrets in logs**        | Passwords, API keys, tokens, and encryption keys must never appear in log output or error messages.                       |
| **IPC input validation**      | All IPC handlers must validate input types and reject malformed payloads before processing.                               |
| **SSRF protection**           | Image download endpoints (`image.ipc.ts`) must validate URLs against SSRF attacks (no internal IPs, no file:// protocol). |
| **Path traversal prevention** | File path inputs must be validated to prevent `../` traversal, absolute path injection, and symlink attacks.              |

### 8.6 Component & UI Rules

| Rule                          | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reuse existing components** | Check `src/renderer/components/ui/` before creating new UI primitives. Use the existing `Modal`, `Button`, etc.                        |
| **No inline styles**          | Use Tailwind classes exclusively. No `style={{ }}` props.                                                                              |
| **Lucide icons only**         | Use `lucide-react` for all icons. Do not import other icon libraries.                                                                  |
| **Accessible**                | All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA labels. Modals must trap focus.                                                    |
| **Dark mode**                 | All UI must work in both light and dark modes. Use Tailwind's design tokens (e.g., `bg-card`, `text-foreground`) not hardcoded colors. |

### 8.7 Import & Module Rules

| Rule                               | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Path aliases**                   | Use `@/` for `src/main/`, `@renderer/` for `src/renderer/`, `@shared/` for `src/shared/`.                               |
| **No circular imports**            | Modules must not have circular dependencies. Main → Shared is OK. Renderer → Shared is OK. Main ↔ Renderer is NEVER OK. |
| **Shared types only in `shared/`** | Types used by both main and renderer must be in `src/shared/types/`.                                                    |
| **IPC channels in constants**      | All IPC channel strings must be defined in `src/shared/constants/ipc-channels.ts`, never hardcoded in handlers.         |

## 9. IPC Development Checklist

When adding a new IPC endpoint:

1. **Define channel** in `src/shared/constants/ipc-channels.ts`.
2. **Define types** for request/response in `src/shared/types/`.
3. **Implement handler** in `src/main/ipc/` with input validation.
4. **Expose in preload** via `src/preload/index.ts` (`contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld`).
5. **Call from renderer** via `window.api.newMethod()`.
6. **Add tests** for the handler (valid inputs, invalid inputs, error paths).

## 10. Skill System Conventions

### File Format

Skills are stored as SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description
version: 1.0.0
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---

# Skill Instructions

Markdown content here...
```

### Sync Rules

- **DB is the source of truth** for metadata displayed in the UI.
- **SKILL.md files** are the source of truth for instructions/content.
- When metadata is edited in the UI (`EditSkillModal`), both DB and SKILL.md frontmatter are updated (`syncFrontmatterToRepo()`).
- When SKILL.md file changes on disk, the DB is synced via `syncSkillFromRepo()`.
- The `METADATA_KEYS` constant in `skill-repo-sync.ts` defines which fields are considered metadata: `name`, `description`, `version`, `tags`, `author`, `model`.

### Validation

- Skill names must match `/^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/` (lowercase, hyphens, no leading/trailing hyphens).
- SKILL.md must have valid YAML frontmatter with required `name` field.
- `parseSkillMd()` in `skill-validator.ts` handles parsing; edge cases (empty frontmatter, missing delimiters) are documented in tests.

## 11. Git & Commit Conventions

| Rule                     | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conventional Commits** | `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `style:`.        |
| **Scope optional**       | `feat(skill): add frontmatter sync` or `fix: correct Gemini routing`.               |
| **Imperative mood**      | "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature".                                |
| **No auto-commit**       | AI agents must never commit without explicit user instruction.                      |
| **Atomic commits**       | Each commit should represent one logical change. Don't mix features with bug fixes. |
| **All tests must pass**  | `pnpm test -- --run` and `pnpm lint` must both pass before committing.              |

## 12. Known Caveats & Gotchas

| Issue                           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQLite null byte truncation** | `better-sqlite3` silently truncates strings at `\x00`. Always strip null bytes from user input.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **FTS5 special operators**      | Search queries containing `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`, `*`, `^`, `"`, or `column:` are interpreted as FTS5 operators and may cause syntax errors if not properly escaped.                                                                           |
| **Electron process boundary**   | Objects passed via IPC are serialized (structured clone). Functions, class instances, and circular references cannot cross the IPC boundary.                                                                                                       |
| **Skill sync race condition**   | `useEffect` in `SkillFullDetailPage` triggers `syncSkillFromRepo()` on `updated_at` change, which can overwrite metadata edits if the SKILL.md file hasn't been updated yet. This is mitigated by `syncFrontmatterToRepo()` in the update handler. |
| **Empty string vs null**        | Some DB methods convert `""` to `null` via `value                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     | null`. Be explicit about whether empty strings should be preserved. |
| **Flaky time-based tests**      | Avoid relying on `Date.now()` for ordering. Use explicit timestamps or deterministic sequencing in tests.                                                                                                                                          |
